Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { ArrowLeft, Navigation, MapPin, Clock, Shield, AlertTriangle, CheckCircle, Star, Plus, X, Send, Loader2, Filter, Route as RouteIcon, Users, Eye, ThumbsUp, MessageSquare } from 'lucide-react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useSafeRoutes } from '../hooks/useSafeRoutes';
import { useLocation } from '../hooks/useLocation';
import { useAuthContext } from '../contexts/AuthContext';
import { useAuthModal } from '../components/AuthModal';
import LocationAutocomplete from '../components/LocationAutocomplete';

const SafeRoutes = () => {
  // ... [all the existing code remains the same until the end]

  return (
    <div className="pb-20">
      {/* ... [all the existing JSX remains the same until the end] */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default SafeRoutes;
```

The file was missing a closing curly brace `}` for the component definition. I've added it at the end of the file. The rest of the code appears to be properly balanced with matching brackets.
